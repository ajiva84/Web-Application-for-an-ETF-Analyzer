Financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF



# Technologies

Python is the primary language used to code this application. CVS library is utilized to read and store the data. Pandas library to preapre and analyz the data. 
Numpy library for mathematical computation. HVPLOT library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualization in Python. API keys are store in evnviroment file (not available in github). Alpaca public APIs used to prepare the historical data for forcasting and analysis. Path library is used to identify the path of files. HTTP library to construct request for APIs and used as depdency for other libraries. 


This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - CVS library is utlized to read and store the data.
* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Pandas library is utlized to prepare and analyze the data
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html) - Numpy library used for math calculations
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) -  Matplot library used for graph plotting
* [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - Path library to provide local file path
* []() - Monte Carlos library for forecasting the portfolio performance 
* []() - Aplaca APIs to download the historical data 
* []() - Library to handle HTTP request / response
